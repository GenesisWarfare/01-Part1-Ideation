# 🎮 Question 1 – Life as a Game

## 🧤 Banquet Waiter Game
The player takes the role of a waiter at a large event (wedding, bar mitzvah, etc.).  
They must serve tables, deliver dishes and drinks, and earn as many tips as possible — all while avoiding the head waiter patrolling the hall.  
If the boss comes near, the player has to pretend to be working.  
Timed challenges (e.g., “serve table 3 in under 30 seconds”) and risk-reward actions such as secretly drinking shots with guests make the gameplay dynamic and humorous.

## 💪 Fitness Trainer Game
The player is a gym coach who progresses by creating personalized workout plans, taking care of clients, and keeping them motivated.  
At the same time, the trainer manages their social-media presence — posting videos, gaining followers, and attracting new clients.  
As reputation and popularity grow, the player unlocks new equipment, special clients, and upgraded training areas.

## 🏺 Pottery Studio Game
The player owns and manages a pottery studio, creating ceramic pieces for sale.  
They must follow social-media trends that influence which designs are in demand — the more viral an item becomes, the higher the profit.  
Gameplay mixes hands-on creation (sculpting, painting, glazing) with light business management such as handling materials, pricing, and marketing.
